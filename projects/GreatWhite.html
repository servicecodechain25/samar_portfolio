      <p>
    The <strong>“As Tiger”</strong> campaign by GreatWhite Electricals is a bold and
    stylish branding initiative that draws a powerful parallel between the brand’s
    product attributes and the personality of its ambassador, Tiger Shroff. Known
    for strength, agility, and effortless style, the campaign positions GreatWhite’s
    offerings as “As Stylish as Tiger”, “As Dazzling as Tiger”, and “As Tough as
    Tiger”, bringing together performance, design, and durability under one strong
    and cohesive message.
</p>

<p>
    Designed to connect with a broad audience including homeowners, young
    professionals, designers, and builders, the campaign spans print, outdoor,
    television, and digital platforms. With a confident and aspirational tone,
    GreatWhite Electricals reinforces its identity as a forward-thinking, premium
    brand that doesn’t just power homes — it adds personality to them.
